	/*1. Selenium IDE
	Think of this like a tape recorder for your browser.
	You click around, and it records your steps. Later, you can just hit play to repeat them.
	You record yourself logging into a website, and next time it does it automatically.

	2. Selenium WebDriver
	This is where the real coding power comes in.
	You write code (Java, Python, etc.) to tell the browser exactly what to do.
	An online store writes code to test if their checkout works on Chrome, Firefox, etc.

	3. Selenium Grid
	Imagine you have many computers testing at the same time.
	That’s what Grid does—it saves time by running tests in parallel on different browsers and systems.
	A big company tests their app on 50 devices and browsers all at once.

	4. Selenium RC (Remote Control) – Old stuff
	This was the grandparent of Selenium tools. It used some tricks with JavaScript to run tests.
	Now it’s retired, but it paved the way for WebDriver.
	Some old systems might still have it lying around.*/
